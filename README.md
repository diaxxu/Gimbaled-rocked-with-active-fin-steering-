#  DIY Rocket with TVC & Active Fin Steerin

This is my custom-designed rocket made in **Fusion 360**, featuring:

- Thrust Vector Control (TVC) using 2-axis servo-actuated rings
- Active fin steering system for stability & contro
- Modular electronics bay (E-Bay) for guidance, telemetry, and recovery
- Designed for experimental testing with onboard sensor

---

##  Key Components

###  Thrust Vector Control (TVC)
- Dual-ring gimbal system for 2-axis movement (Pitch/Yaw)
- Controlled by two servos positioned 90¬∞ apart
- Motor is mounted in the inner ring
- Outer ring fixed to rocket body via pivots

###  Active Fin System
- Four CNC-style fins
- Mounted with servo-controlled rotation (each fin individually adjustable)
- Controlled via Raspberry Pi / Arduino with PID loop or mixing logic

###  E-Bay (Electronics Bay)
- Houses all flight electronics:
  - IMU / Gyroscope
  - GPS module
  - Telemetry Radio (e.g., LoRa)
  - Parachute ejection system (planned)
- Designed for easy access and modular swaps

---

##  Build Material (Prototype)
- 3D printed parts (PLA / PETG for test prints)
- Carbon fiber for main fuselage (planned)
- Aluminum or plywood for internal support
- Screws, hinges, bearings as needed

---

## üí° Next Steps
- Static fire testing of TVC system
- Full integration of flight computer
- Parachute deployment system
- Launch & flight data logging

## üí¨ Credits
Made by a student passionate about aerospace, robotics, and DIY rocketry.  
Modeled fully in Fusion 360, inspired by real missile guidance systems.
